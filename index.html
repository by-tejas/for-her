<h1>I didn’t expect much when we first started talking.</h1>
<p>We matched over a month ago, on 25th December, 2025.<br><br>
I didn’t expect much when we first started talking, but that changed as the days passed — especially after we switched to Instagram on 28th December.<br><br>
I really liked talking to you… something I didn’t realize would slowly become a part of my daily routine.<br><br>
Back then, I didn’t know these little, unexpected conversations would turn into the part of my day I look forward to the most.
</p>

<h1>Our First Date</h1>
<p>New year. New beginnings.<br><br>
We had our first date on 14th January, 2026 at Phoenix Marketcity, Kurla — and you were an hour late hehehe.<br><br>
But I didn’t mind waiting. I was genuinely looking forward to meeting you, and that one hour was truly worth it. So worth it that I wouldn’t be able to put it into words even if I tried.<br><br>
It wouldn’t be an understatement to say it was the best first date I’ve ever had. I hadn’t had that much fun in a while.<br><br>
Thank you for letting me win in air hockey madam 😂 I’m very grateful for your sacrifice and kindness.<br><br>
And the funniest part? I forgot to give you the gift I got you… but maybe someone wanted to give us a reason to meet again. So I definitely don’t mind hehe.
</p>

<h1>Our Second Date</h1>
<p>Our second date at Bandra Mcd was a simple but genuinely fun one — the kind of date I feel is underrated.<br><br>
We ate a little, talked a lot, got to know each other better, and just spent time together. What’s there not to like about that, right?<br><br>
I witnessed your bargaining skills for the first time and I was genuinely impressed… kyuki mujhse toh nahi hoga definitely 💀.<br><br>
Our little walk to the station after that was special. We held hands for the first time, and it honestly felt like a dream tbh.<br><br>
I finally got to give you my gift — the jhumkas station pe — and your smile and happiness made the wait completely worth it. That’s a moment I’ll definitely remember 😁.

<h1>Our Third Date</h1>
<p>Pehli baar churchgate tak kisi k liye aaya tha… and kyu nahi aaunga, tujhe jo milna tha and tere liye utna toh karunga hi.<br><br>
It was my first time in Kala Ghoda, and my first time visiting the Kala Ghoda Festival. Kaafi crazy and creative art display tha — but mere liye best piece of art toh tu hi thi obviously (sorry had to say it hehe).<br><br>
This was also the day I asked you to be my Valentine — something I did for the very first time in my life.<br><br>
Thoda nervous toh tha, but somewhere I felt like you would like it. And tera reaction was better than anything I could have imagined.<br><br>
It was truly worth everything and felt nothing short of a sweet dream. Definitely one of the best moments I’ve experienced in my life ❤️.<br><br>
Uske liye thank you meri jaan 😘.

<h1>Our Fourth Date</h1>
<p>Our first proper weekend day date.<br><br>
We weren’t twinning… but somehow we were dressed so similarly, jaise humara ek mind connection ban gaya ho.<br><br>
You looked heavenly that day. Swarg se aayi apsara jaisi.<br><br>
It was also the first time we clicked pictures together hehe.<br><br>
I still look at those pictures from time to time whenever I miss you 😘.

<h1>Our Fifth Date</h1>
<p>
Another chill date — anna idli and long talks in the park.<br><br>
Spending time together without anything fancy feels underrated.<br><br>
The teddy drawing you made was really sweet. Tu toh hai hi cutieee!!<br><br>
And your letter… you really do have great vision.

<h1>The Moments That Stayed With Me</h1>
<p>Our daily chats.<br><br>
Our occasional calls.<br><br>
Our short dates.<br><br>
Our little moments of banter, holding hands, hugging you and keeping you close.<br><br>
These are some of the things I’ve really come to cherish in such a short time — something I would have never expected just a month ago.<br><br>
Whenever I used to hear someone say, “She’s the one who adds colour to my life,” I would think maybe they were exaggerating.<br><br>
But now I know… it’s completely TRUE.<br><br>
You genuinely add colour to my life — something that would have felt dull and ordinary otherwise.<br><br>
A short voice note or even a random picture from you can brighten my entire day.<br><br>
Not getting a reply from you makes me a little sad.<br><br>
Thinking about you at random moments during the day has somehow become an involuntary activity now 😂.<br><br>
There’s so much more I feel, but words will never fully capture everything.<br><br>
All I know is that I really care about you deeply.<br><br>
And that’s why I don’t want this to just stay in the “almost” zone anymore.<br><br>
I want to take this… take US… one step forward.<br><br>
And give it a name — girlfriend and boyfriend — if you want it too.
